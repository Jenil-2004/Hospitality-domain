# Hospitality-domain
This project aims to analyze and visualize key performance metrics in the hospitality industry using Power BI. The focus metrics include revenue, RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), occupancy percentage, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and realization metrics. These insights are crucial for understanding and optimizing hotel performance and revenue generation strategies.

Key metrics 

a. Revenue Analysis
Total Revenue:
Sum of all revenue generated across various hotel services (accommodation, dining, amenities).

b. RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
Calculation:
RevPAR = (Total Room Revenue / Number of Available Rooms)
Provides insight into how effectively rooms are monetized.

c. Occupancy Percentage
Calculation:
Occupancy % = (Rooms Sold / Available Rooms) * 100
Indicates the utilization of available rooms.

d. ADR (Average Daily Rate)
Calculation:
ADR = Total Room Revenue / Number of Rooms Sold
Average rate charged per occupied room per night.

e. Realization Metrics
Realization:
Analyze actual revenue versus projected revenue to measure performance against targets.
